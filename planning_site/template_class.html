				<h2>Brief</h2>
				<p>The aim of my internal is to create a programme which allows users to have an interactive ordering experience from Marsdenâ€™s Gourmet Sandwich Bar. This means my programme is able to document the customers order and then allow them to review their order when called upon to do so. It needs to be able to show the completed order and total cost of it and for users to be able to edit what they have ordered. The programme needs to offer delivery options and take customer information so that it knows who has ordered what. When an order is completed, the programme needs to offer an option for a new order to be placed otherwise it needs to complete the order and finish. </p>

    <h2>Sprint One</h2>
	<h4>Sprint Aim</h4>
		<p>My Sprint One aim is to create a basic programme that is able to print all sandwich options for the user, including prices and dietary requirements. I also want to create options for the user allowing them to decide if they want to read the Sandwich menu or leave the programme. This needs to be done in order to create a backbone for the rest of my programme. As well as this I want to create my Github repository so I am able to store all of my sprints and planning here. Doing all of this means I will be able to build on the site because I will have a good foundation to work off of.</p>

<!-- Sprint 2 -->
<h1>Sprint Two</h1>
<h4>Sprint Aim</h4>
				<p>My Sprint Two aim is to develop my programme so that customers are now not only able to view the menu but to order sandwiches and review their order. In this review I want the user to be able to see the total cost of their amount of sandwiches they have bought, the individual price of the sandwiches, the dietary category and how many they have ordered of each. When making these I need to make sure I am able to easily develop this system so in future versions customers are able to remove things from their order, select delivery as an option and potentially enabling customers to create custom sandwiches.</p>

<!-- Sprint 3 -->
<h1>Sprint Three</h1>
<h4>Sprint Aim</h4>
	<p>My Sprint Three aim is to further develop my website by allowing the user to edit their order. This means they will be able to change the amount of sandwiches that they have ordered and remove ones they no longer want from their order. I also want the user to be able to select whether or not they would like delivery or pickup for this order. This would also mean that they are able to enter their details into the system and choose their preferred option. </p>

	<h4>Sprint Three Error</h4>
		<p>In this sprint I encountered an error which involved validation. If an invalid index number was entered instead of the program asking the user to enter another index number which is valid it instead crashed the program. This means that if the user accidentally clicked the wrong number of made a mistake when entering the program would crash instead of letting them renter their answer. By validating this it means that the user is able to make a mistake and renter a correct response instead of the program crashing and them losing all of their information. </p>
